# the notation for the synaptic parameters is as follows:
# B blocker, C collector, S spike source, (2, 4)
# w weight, d delay, (1)
# a one's own, z other, (3)
# i inhibition, e excitation  (5)
# If B is before C than the connection is from B to C.
# Example: dSaB would mean a dealy from a spike source to the one's own blocker neuron, and
# wSzB would be the weight from a spike source to the heterolateral blocker neuron.
